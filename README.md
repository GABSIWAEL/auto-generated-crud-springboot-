### Entities

Entity classes are located in the `entities` package. These classes are annotated with JPA annotations and represent the database tables.

### Controllers

Controller classes are located in the `controllers` package. These classes handle HTTP requests and map them to service calls.

### Repositories

Repository interfaces are located in the `repositories` package. These interfaces extend `JpaRepository` to provide CRUD operations.

### Services

Service interfaces are located in the `services` package. These interfaces define the business logic methods.

### Service Implementations

Service implementation classes are located in the `serviceimpl` package. These classes implement the service interfaces and contain the actual business logic.

### Enumerations

Enumeration classes are located in the `entities` package. These classes define enumerated types used by the entities.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GeneratedSpringBootProject.git
   cd GeneratedSpringBootProject
Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

Make sure you have JDK 11 or higher installed.

Build the project:


./mvnw clean install
Run the application:


./mvnw spring-boot:run
Usage
After starting the application, you can access the REST API endpoints via a tool like Postman or a web browser.

Example Endpoints
Retrieve all entities: GET /{entityName}/retrieve-all
Retrieve a single entity by ID: GET /{entityName}/retrieve/{id}
Add a new entity: POST /{entityName}/add
Update an existing entity: PUT /{entityName}/modify
Delete an entity: DELETE /{entityName}/remove/{id}
Replace {entityName} with the actual name of your entity.

Generating Code
The code generation script automates the creation of entity classes, controllers, repositories, services, and enumerations. The script ensures consistency and reduces boilerplate code.
